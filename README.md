# flower-image-classification
This repo consists the code for a particular scenario, which is explained briefly as,

A flower bouquet shop wants to enhance its customer experience by implementing an image classification component. The goal is to create a mobile app that allows customers to take pictures of flowers they encounter and receive information about the flower species, care instructions, and the option to order similar flowers.

I have developed a model which can perform the image classification task with CNN and for the classified flower plant it can also give some care instructions


# dataset description
Dataset contains 5 classes of flowers

daisy

dandelion

sunflowers

roses

tuplips



To reduce the complexity I have normalized the pixels and I have done data augmentation also to avoid the overfitting of the model.At last I have created a dictionary with flower names and care instructions so that the customer can receive information about the flower species and care instructions
